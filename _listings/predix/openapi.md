      summary: Upload an artifact and attach it to an analytic catalog entry.
      description: Upload a single artifact file in a multipart MIME structure and
        attach it to an analytic catalog entry. The multipart MIME structure must
        have the catalog entry id tagged as 'catalogEntryId',  the file contents tagged
        as 'file',  the artifact type tagged as 'type', and  a description (under
        1024 characters) tagged as 'description'. Artifact types can be any string.  Artifacts
        with the type 'executable' must contain the executable for the analytic.   An
        analytic can only have 1 artifact labelled as 'executable'(See the documentation
        for more information regarding these files.)
